* axi_to_native_fifo.vhd, native_fifo_to_axi.vhd
Simple logic to convert Xilinx native FIFO standard to AXIS standard

* connector.vhd [AXIS]
Connects two AXIS modules

* dword_filler.vhd [AXIS]
Converts 128b (4x32b DWORDS) with 4bit keep signal (currently valid - need to
be changed) to one 32b DWORD. Currenlt it doesnt support every combination of
keep signal (dedicated only for PCIe).

* dword_serializer.vhd [AXIS]
Converts 128bit (every chunk valid) to 32bit

* multi_s_axis_switch.vhd, single_s_axis_switch.vhd [AXIS]
