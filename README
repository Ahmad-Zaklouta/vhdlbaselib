		descroption TO DO
		
3) Every module has its test test bench with the same name and '_tb' suffix



		Vendor settings
Some of the modules in library have multiple architectures. It can be changed
by exporting makefile variable [ENTIY_NAME]_ARCH = [ARCH]. Where ENTIY_NAME is the
name of the entity which is arch selected for. Entities which have multiple
architectures are:
	- sync/sync_block
Arch is VHDL architecture to be selected. By default its value is 'infer' when
pure VHDL withou vendors libs is used. Other values might be:
	- xilinx
	- intel (not yet supported)
